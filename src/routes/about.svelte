<h2>Our Founders</h2>

<h3>Grace Radkins</h3>

<p>Grace first learned about Intersection through the 2014 Printer’s Row
Human Library Chicago event. After reading an article covering the
event, she reached out and asked to volunteer in any way needed, and has
been a member of the board and an event volunteer since then. Being a
part of Intersection/HLC has helped Grace to find more fruitful and
compassionate ways to listen and communicate, and she is grateful for
that. Grace loves to read, knit, and go to Zumba class, and her favorite
cuisines are Italian and Vietnamese. She is a librarian and works in the
archives of a local radio station.</p>

<h3>Marlena Johnson</h3>

<p>Marlena is the cofounder of Intersection, which stemmed out of the
desire to expand the work of the Human Library Chicago chapter.
Throughout her career, Marlena has worked in the nonprofit sector.
During this time, she has encountered a severe lack of knowledge about
the lived experiences of those facing adversity and how this lack of
understanding by others affects the quality of life of these
individuals. Through Intersection, she hopes to create a platform in
which the voices that are often lost in our society are brought forward.
In her spare time, Marlena enjoys exploring her native city of Chicago,
photography, and watching Golden Girls episodes over and over again.</p>

<h3>Oscar Xuarez</h3>

<p>Oscar has been working with the Human Library Chicago since the 2014
Printer’s Row event. While working in the the private sector as a
Political Researcher he grew to understand the disparity between people
and that there is a need to help foster understanding amongst people of
varying backgrounds. In his current work in a non-profit working with
inner city youth has only tempered the need to help create a space
allowing people to step outside their comfort zones while truly learning
and understanding one another. In his spare time, Oscar likes to drop
the bass as a Wedding DJ, trying to figure out the killer in Sherlock
before the episode ends, or also exploring the city of Chicago with
Marlena or Marvin.</p>

<h3>Alan Ashbeck</h3>

<p>Alan has been with the Intersection and the Human Library Chicago since
its first event Human Library event at the 2014 Printer’s Row festival.
His career has focused on bridging gaps between groups of people by way
of academic research, technology, and direct person to person contact
via Human Library events. Alan continues his work both professionally at
Northwestern University, where he is a software engineer working on web
and mobile applications for behavioral health research, and through
Intersection, where he takes on the roles of Treasurer of the Board of
Directors, and as Data and Metrics Analyst. In his limited, spare time,
Alan likes to play guitar, lift heavy weights, and work on tech
projects.</p>
